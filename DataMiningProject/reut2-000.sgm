<TITLE>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SALVADOR, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp told employees it
was reducing the funds available for merit-raises for 109,000
salaried workers.
    GM, which has been taking wide-ranging steps to cut costs,
said in a letter it cut the amount available for raises to 3.5
pct of the payroll from 5.5 pct in 1986.
    The letter also said raises will be given in one annual
lump-sum payment from April rather than being folded into
salaries and thus increasing the base for benefit payments.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;BP Oil Ltd>, the U.K. Marketing and
refining arm of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>, raised its
pretax operating profit on a replacement cost basis to 182 mln
stg in calendar 1986, compared with 66 mln stg in 1985.
    Sales and operating revenue fell to 3.1 billion stg from
4.2 billion on a replacement cost basis. Historical cost
operating profit was 61 mln stg, up from 16 mln.
    BP Oil said 1985 profits had been depressed by exceptional
items. Its profit figures were stated before interest charges.
    Chief executive David Kendall said improved results
mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in
recent years.
    However, he warned future financial pressure on the
industry will be severe.
    "The U.K. Oil marketing and refining industry will need to
invest larger sums - probably around 500 mln stg a year - for a
good many years," he said in a statement.

<TITLE>EARTHQUAKES CONTINUE IN NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Earthquakes and aftershocks are still
shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's
strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.
    Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale
have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east
since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).
    No casualties have been reported and no further major
damage, civil defence sources said.
    A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North
Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.
    The seismologist said if the pattern of other large
earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to
several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the
chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.

<TITLE>U.S. ASKS JAPAN END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
    The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
Congress.
    Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
    Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
    He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
the spokesman said.
    Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.
